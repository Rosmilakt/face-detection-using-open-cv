# Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV 🎥🧠

This is a simple Python project that performs real-time face detection using OpenCV and a pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier.

## 📸 Project Description

This project captures live video from your webcam and detects human faces in real time. It uses the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` model provided by OpenCV to identify faces and draws rectangles around them.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV (cv2)**
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**
- **Webcam / Camera**

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Capture live video using `cv2.VideoCapture`.
2. Convert each video frame to grayscale.
3. Detect faces using Haar Cascade classifier.
4. Draw rectangles around detected faces.
5. Display the output in a window.
6. Exit the window on pressing `q`.
